1. Create an array with numbers,string,an array and an object.
2. Ooops i meant object. So you need to take the array from step 1 and change it to an object, programatically.
3. Please donÂ´t cheat, object with curly braces.
4. Make this object kind of 'reusable' but let's say only for Internet Explorer 10
5. Show this object 'graphically' in the browser.
6. Store the object in a database from the browser.
